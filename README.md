### Background

This project is part of **Capstone 2** in the **Job Connector Data Science Program**, aiming to apply data science techniques to real-world public health issues. In today’s rapidly changing environment, population health is increasingly influenced by lifestyle shifts, environmental conditions, and demographic transitions. Large-scale health data plays a critical role in helping policymakers, healthcare providers, and public health practitioners understand disease distribution, mental well-being, and obesity risks. Through a data-driven approach, this analysis explores interconnected health factors to identify patterns, disparities, and potential risk groups, ultimately supporting more targeted and effective public health interventions.

### Dataset Overview

The analysis is conducted on a health dataset containing **289,800 individuals** with **79 variables**, covering multiple dimensions of community health. The dataset includes attributes related to:

* **Demographics**: age, gender, region, marital status, and other population characteristics
* **Health conditions**: disease history, height, weight, BMI (IMT), and mental health status
* **Lifestyle behaviors**: smoking habits, alcohol consumption, dietary patterns, and daily activities
* **Environmental factors**: household sanitation, access to public facilities, and surrounding living conditions

### Analysis Scope

This project consists of several analytical stages, including:

* **Data preprocessing** to clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis
* **Correlation analysis** to explore relationships between health, lifestyle, and demographic variables
* **Exploratory data visualization** to uncover patterns in disease prevalence, mental well-being, and obesity across different population groups

In addition, **logistic regression analysis** is applied to examine:

* The relationship between **marital status** and **poor mental health conditions**
* The association between **obesity (BMI category)** and **poor mental health outcomes**

### Key Outcome

The analysis generates various insights into disease distribution, mental health vulnerability, and obesity risks across demographic groups. These findings provide a data-driven foundation for understanding community health challenges and support the development of more targeted, equitable, and evidence-based public health strategies.
